##  How It Works

The **React** frontend **communicates** with the **Laravel** backend via protected API endpoints. This architectural separation **ensures** that the business logic and data management are decoupled from the presentation layer, allowing for better scalability, easier maintenance, and a more **articulate** codebase.
